 ## [CH32V307-Blink](https://wch-ic.com/products/CH32V307.html) 

This code makes two LEDs blink in a cycle.

Here's what it does:

 1. It turns on one LED (PA15) and turns off the other LED (PB4).
 2. Then, it waits for a short time (500 milliseconds).
 3. Next, it turns off the first LED (PA15) and turns on the second LED (PB4).
 4. It waits again for a short time (500 milliseconds).
 5. It keeps repeating steps 1-4, so the LEDs keep blinking in a cycle.

Think of it like a seesaw: when one LED is on, the other is off, and they keep switching back and forth.
